We would like to thank you for considering to contribute to the EVE framework!
Your help enables EVE to be the tool that researchers need to run virtual reality experiments smoothly.

If you want to help expanding EVE there is a few ways you can help:

# Improve tutorials

Something is unclear about the tutorial? You have a tutorial of your own? Please contact us to add your material to the tutorial section.

# Add your experiment logic to EVE

We are trying to make experimentation easier by providing prefabs for all kinds of experiment logic.
If you have implemented a new kind of experiment logic that is not yet part of EVE, please consider
making a pull-request with your code. We will review your work and work closely with you to add your
work to EVE.

# Bug-Fixing

You noticed that something does not work appropriately?
You can try to fix it yourself and send us a pull-request with the fix.
If you don't have the time or the capabilities to fix the problem, please create an issue, so our programmers can have a look.

# Code Cleaning

We try to have a clean and nice code base, but there are always things that can be improved.
If you think you can improve the inner workings of EVE, please make an issue for the kind of improvements you have in mind and make pull-requests for your code.

# New Features

EVE is trying to provide the basic structure to run your experiment, but there may be features that go beyond experimental logic in the form of prefabs.
If that is the case, please create an issue, use a pull-request and contact us personally, so we can find a way to integrate your work in the overall developmental plan of eve.
