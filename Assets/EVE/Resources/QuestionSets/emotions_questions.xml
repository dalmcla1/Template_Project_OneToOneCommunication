      <Text><![CDATA[<b><size=48>Emotion questionnaire</size></b>

You will now be asked a series of questions about how much you felt particular emotions while you were walking through the neighborhood collecting gems. Please answer these questions by thinking about how you felt while walking through the neighborhood, not about how you feel right now. There are no right or wrong answers, so please respond as honestly as you can, to the best of your ability.

If you have any questions, please ask at any time.]]></Text>
